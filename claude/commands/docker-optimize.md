# Docker Optimization Request

Optimizing Docker configuration: $ARGUMENTS

I'll use the **docker-optimizer** agent to analyze and optimize your Docker setup.

## The agent will:

- **Analyze current Dockerfile** for optimization opportunities
- **Detect application type** and recommend framework-specific optimizations
- **Design multi-stage builds** for minimal production images
- **Implement security hardening** (non-root user, vulnerability scanning, distroless)
- **Optimize build performance** with caching and layer ordering
- **Configure runtime settings** for optimal performance

## Optimization includes:

- Base image selection (Alpine, Slim, Distroless, Scratch)
- Multi-stage build design
- Size reduction (50-98% typical reduction)
- Security scanning and hardening
- Build time improvements
- Framework-specific best practices (Node.js/Bun, Python/UV, Go, Rust, Java/GraalVM)

## Output:

- Comprehensive analysis report
- Optimized Dockerfile(s)
- Before/after comparison
- Security scan results
- Migration guide
