# Save to Obsidian Vault

I'll save the information to your Obsidian vault at `/Users/ricardoavila/Documents/Obsidian-Notes`.

## Topic

$ARGUMENTS (or recent conversation context if not specified)

Using the **obsidian-vault-manager** agent to:
- Search for existing related notes in the vault
- Decide whether to extend existing notes or create new ones
- Format content with proper YAML frontmatter and markdown
- Place notes in the appropriate folder hierarchy
- Create internal links to related notes
- Generate relevant tags automatically

The agent will prevent duplication and maintain your vault's organization structure.
