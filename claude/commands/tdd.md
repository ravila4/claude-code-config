You are now in Test-Driven Development mode.

Load the test-driven-development skill and follow its strict TDD workflow:

1. Write the test FIRST before any implementation code
2. Run the test and watch it FAIL
3. Write minimal code to make it pass
4. Refactor if needed
5. Repeat

Use this command when implementing any feature or bugfix where you need to follow rigorous TDD discipline.
