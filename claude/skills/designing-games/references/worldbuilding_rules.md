# Worldbuilding Rules

Principles for creating consistent, engaging game worlds. Based on Sanderson's Laws of Magic, generalized to any system.

## Sanderson's Laws (Generalized)

### First Law: Clarity Enables Resolution

**Original:** "An author's ability to solve problems with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic."

**Generalized:** Systems can only solve problems in proportion to how well the player understands them.

**Implications:**
- Deus ex machina breaks engagement
- Mysterious systems can create problems, not solve them
- Player agency requires system transparency
- "Soft" systems (vague rules) suit atmosphere; "hard" systems (clear rules) suit challenge

**Application:**
- If a skill check will save the player, explain skill checks early
- If an item will be crucial, establish its properties first
- Victory should feel earned, not gifted

### Second Law: Limitations Over Powers

**Original:** "Limitations are more interesting than powers."

**Generalized:** Constraints create drama; unlimited capability is boring.

**Implications:**
- A hero who can do anything faces no tension
- Costs, cooldowns, and consequences create decisions
- "Superman problem": omnipotence is narrative poison
- The interesting question is "can they?" not "will they?"

**Application:**
- Every ability needs a limitation
- Resources should be scarce enough to matter
- Trade-offs beat upgrades
- Failure states must be possible

### Third Law: Expand Before Adding

**Original:** "Expand what you have before adding something new."

**Generalized:** Depth beats breadth; mine existing elements before introducing new ones.

**Implications:**
- Complexity creep dilutes each element
- Interconnections between few elements beat many isolated elements
- New systems need justification
- Players can only track so much

**Application:**
- Before adding a new mechanic, ask: "Can an existing mechanic do this?"
- Find new uses for established tools
- Interconnect systems (magic affects combat affects dialogue)
- Cut features that don't interact with others

## The Iceberg Principle

**Show 10%, imply 90%.**

Players don't need to know everything. They need to *believe* there's more.

**Implementation:**
- Reference events/places/people that exist only as flavor
- Leave some questions unanswered (intentionally)
- NPCs should have lives beyond the player's scope
- History should predate the story

**Warning:** Don't create inconsistency. The 90% must be *consistent*, even if unseen.

## Consistency Enforcement

### The Rules Document

Every world should have (even if players never see it):
- How does [magic/technology/society] work?
- What are the limits?
- What are the exceptions, and why?
- What's impossible, with no exceptions?

### The Exception Problem

Exceptions undermine rules. Use sparingly.

**Acceptable exceptions:**
- Foreshadowed special cases ("Ancient artifacts can do what modern ones can't")
- High cost ("You can break the rule, but it costs your life")
- Narrative climax ("The one time the rule breaks—because of everything that led here")

**Unacceptable exceptions:**
- Convenience ("The villain can do this because I need them to")
- Forgetting ("Oh, I guess that rule doesn't apply here")
- Power creep ("The new villain is immune to the old rules")

### The Expert Test

Imagine an expert on your world—someone who's read everything.

Ask: "Would this make the expert say 'Wait, that's wrong'?"

If yes, it's a consistency violation.

## Player-Facing Worldbuilding

### What Players Need to Know

**Must know:**
- Rules that affect their choices
- Powers and limitations they have
- Consequences they'll face

**Should know:**
- How the world generally works
- What's normal vs. exceptional
- Basic history and context

**Can discover:**
- Deep lore
- Hidden connections
- Optional backstory

### Revelation Pacing

- **Tutorial:** Core rules (what can I do?)
- **Early game:** World basics (where am I?)
- **Mid game:** Deeper systems (how does this really work?)
- **Late game:** Hidden truths (what's really going on?)

Don't front-load exposition. Let players discover.

## Common Worldbuilding Failures

| Failure | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Magic creep** | Powers expand to solve any problem | Enforce hard limits |
| **Kitchen sink** | Too many unconnected elements | Cut or interconnect |
| **Convenient ignorance** | Characters don't know things they should | Track knowledge logically |
| **Arbitrary obstacles** | Barriers exist only to slow plot | Justify barriers in-world |
| **Inconsistent physics** | Rules change scene to scene | Document rules, enforce them |
| **Monoculture** | Every member of a group is identical | Add internal diversity |

## Genre-Specific Notes

### Fantasy

- Magic system: soft or hard? (Atmosphere vs. puzzle)
- Technology level: what exists, what doesn't?
- Races/species: what distinguishes them mechanically?
- Religion: real gods? Fake? Unknown?

### Sci-Fi

- Technology: what's possible, what's impossible?
- FTL: if yes, what are the limits?
- AI: exists? Sentient? Rights?
- Aliens: how alien? (Rubber-forehead vs. truly foreign)

### Horror

- Threat rules: what can hurt you? What can't?
- Safety rules: what protects you? Consistently?
- Information: what can be known? What's unknowable?
- Escalation: how does the threat grow?

### Mystery

- Information availability: what can the player discover?
- Red herrings: fair? (Clued as false)
- Solution: achievable with available information?
- Revelations: properly foreshadowed?
