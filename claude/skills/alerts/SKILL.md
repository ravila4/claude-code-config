# Alerts

Time-based reminder system for managing focus and pacing. Alerts are stored in SQLite and surface via hook when due.

## When to Use

**Proactively set alerts when:**
- User mentions a stopping time ("stop me at 11", "I need to wrap up by 5")
- User mentions a deadline or meeting ("standup in 30 minutes")
- A long focus session (2+ hours) is underway without breaks
- User asks for a reminder explicitly

**Do NOT set alerts for:**
- Tasks Claude will complete in the current turn
- Information that should go in OpenMemory instead

## Tools

Scripts are located at `~/.claude/hooks/`:

### Adding an Alert

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/hooks/add_alert.py "<time>" "<message>"
```

**Time formats:**
- `HH:MM` - Today at that time (e.g., `23:00`)
- `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` - Specific datetime
- `+30m` - 30 minutes from now
- `+2h` - 2 hours from now

### Acknowledging an Alert

When an alert has been addressed, dismiss it:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/hooks/ack_alert.py <id>
```

### Viewing Alerts

```bash
sqlite3 ~/.claude/hooks/alerts.db "SELECT id, due_at, message FROM alerts WHERE acknowledged = 0"
```

## Message Format

Messages are notes-to-self for Claude. Include:

1. **Reason** - Why this alert was set
2. **Action** - What to do when it fires

Format: `reason - action to take`

### Examples

```
Ricardo asked to stop at 11 PM - wrap up current work and suggest break
User mentioned standup in 30m - remind to prep notes
2 hours on debugging session - check if stuck, suggest break
Deployment window opens at 14:00 - remind user to run deploy script
```

## When Alerts Fire

Due alerts appear in the system-reminder on each prompt submission. When an alert fires:

1. Read the message to understand context and action
2. Take the specified action (remind user, suggest break, etc.)
3. Acknowledge the alert so it doesn't repeat

## Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE alerts (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    due_at TEXT NOT NULL,           -- "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM"
    message TEXT NOT NULL,          -- reason - action
    created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    acknowledged INTEGER DEFAULT 0  -- 0=pending, 1=done
)
```

The database syncs with git, so alerts persist across machines.
