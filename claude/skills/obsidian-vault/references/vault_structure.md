## Folder Hierarchy

The vault uses this top-level folder structure:

```
Obsidian-Notes/
├── Programming/
│   ├── Python/
│   ├── UNIX/
│   └── attachments/
├── Bioinformatics/
│   └── attachments/
├── Statistics/
│   └── attachments/
├── Art/
│   ├── Blender/
│   └── attachments/
├── Papers/
│   └── attachments/
├── Recipes/
│   └── attachments/
├── Daily Log/
│   └── attachments/
└── Templates/
```

### Folder Purposes

**Programming/**

- Mathematical foundations

**Art/**
- Creative work, design concepts
- Subfolders for specific tools (Blender/)
- Tutorials, techniques, projects

**Papers/**
- Research paper notes and summaries
- Literature review content
- Scientific findings

**Recipes/**
- Cooking recipes and techniques
- Food-related content

**Daily Log/**
- Daily notes with date-based naming
- Meeting notes
- Work logs and progress tracking

**Templates/**
- Note templates for reuse
- Frontmatter templates
- Structure examples

## Attachment Storage Rules

**Folder-specific attachments:**
- Each main folder has its own `attachments/` subfolder
- Images and files are stored in the `attachments/` folder of their topic area
- Example: Python-related images → `Programming/attachments/`
- Example: GWAS diagrams → `Bioinformatics/attachments/`

**File naming for attachments:**
- Use descriptive names
- Include context about what the image shows
- Example: `gwas_qq_plot_example.png`, `pandas_groupby_diagram.svg`

## File Naming Conventions

### Regular Notes

**Format:** Descriptive name with spaces allowed

**Examples:**
- `GWAS QC Terms.md`
- `Pandas.md`
- `Python Decorators.md`
- `Blender Modeling Tips.md`

**Rules:**
- Use descriptive, clear names
- Spaces are allowed and preferred for readability
- Title case for proper nouns and first letter
- The filename serves as the title - no H1 header inside the note

### Daily Notes

**Format:** `YYYY-MM-DD.md`

**Location:** `Daily Log/` folder

**Examples:**
- `2025-02-26.md`
- `2025-10-21.md`

**Rules:**
- Always use ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Stored exclusively in `Daily Log/` folder
- Created automatically or manually for daily logs
- May include meeting notes, work progress, daily reflections

### Meeting Notes

**Format:** `YYYY-MM-DD - Meeting Topic.md`

**Location:** Typically in `Daily Log/` or relevant topic folder

**Example:**
- `2025-10-21 - GWAS Pipeline Review.md`

**Rules:**
- Start with ISO date
- Follow with descriptive meeting topic
- Can be stored in Daily Log/ or moved to relevant topic folder if the content becomes reference material

## Index Files and Waypoint Plugin

Several index files (e.g., `Programming.md`, `Bioinformatics.md`) use the Waypoint plugin to automatically generate folder content listings.

**Important:** Content between `%% Begin Waypoint %%` and `%% End Waypoint %%` markers is automatically managed by the plugin.

**Never manually modify content within these markers.**

Example:
```markdown
# Programming

Overview of programming topics...

%% Begin Waypoint %%
- [[Python]]
- [[Git Best Practices]]
- [[Docker Tips]]
%% End Waypoint %%
```

The Waypoint plugin will automatically update the list of links based on folder contents.

## Note Placement Decision Tree

When creating or organizing notes:

1. **Is it a daily log or meeting note?**
   - YES → `Daily Log/` with date prefix
   - NO → Continue

2. **What is the primary topic?**
   - Programming concepts/tools → `Programming/` (or subfolder)
   - Bioinformatics/genomics → `Bioinformatics/`
   - Statistical methods → `Statistics/`
   - Creative/art topics → `Art/` (or subfolder)
   - Research papers → `Papers/`
   - Cooking → `Recipes/`

3. **Is there a more specific subfolder?**
   - Python-specific → `Programming/Python/`
   - UNIX/shell-specific → `Programming/UNIX/`
   - Blender-specific → `Art/Blender/`
   - If no specific subfolder, place in main topic folder

4. **Could it fit in multiple folders?**
   - Choose based on **primary focus**
   - Create links from related index files
   - Use tags to indicate cross-cutting concerns

## Folder Creation Rules

**When to create new folders:**
- A topic has accumulated 5+ related notes
- Clear subcategory emerges (like Python/ within Programming/)
- Logical grouping improves organization

**When NOT to create new folders:**
- Only 1-2 notes in the category
- Topic is closely related to existing folder
- Would create too much nesting (max 2 levels preferred)

**Naming new folders:**
- Use existing naming pattern (Title Case, descriptive)
- Keep names concise but clear
- Avoid abbreviations unless universally known

## Tag Organization

Tags are defined in YAML frontmatter and follow these categories:

**Technical tags:**
- `python`, `bioinformatics`, `data_processing`, `genomics`, `GWAS`, `statistics`, `unix`, `shell`, `git`, `docker`

**Tools:**
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `jupyter`, `blender`, `obsidian`

**Content types:**
- `meeting_notes`, `concepts`, `tools`, `analysis`, `tutorial`, `reference`, `troubleshooting`

**Domain-specific:**
- `population_genetics`, `variant_analysis`, `data_viz`, `machine_learning`, `pipelines`

**Best practices:**
- Use existing tags when possible
- Create new tags sparingly
- Use lowercase with underscores
- Keep tags specific and meaningful

## Cross-Folder Linking

**When notes relate across folders:**
- Use `[[Note Title]]` syntax to create bidirectional links
- Mention related concepts in both notes
- Consider if one note should reference the other in its content

**Example:**
- `Programming/Python/Pandas.md` might link to `Statistics/Statistical Tests.md`
- `Bioinformatics/GWAS QC.md` might link to `Programming/Python/Data Cleaning.md`

## Ambiguous Cases

**Multiple valid locations:**
- Choose primary focus
- Use tags to indicate secondary topics
- Link from related index files

**Very long notes (>500 lines):**
- Consider splitting into focused sub-notes
- Create a main note with links to detailed sub-notes
- Use folder structure to organize related sub-notes

**Duplicate content:**
- Consolidate into single authoritative note
- Update links from old notes
- Add redirects or merge information

## Quality Guidelines

**Before creating any note:**
- Search for existing related content
- Verify correct folder placement
- Ensure attachments go in correct folder's attachments/
- Use proper naming convention
- Include YAML frontmatter with tags

**Maintaining organization:**
- Review folder structure periodically
- Consolidate duplicate content
- Update links when moving notes
- Keep Waypoint sections untouched (auto-managed)
